=============

This project is heavily influenced by Enso from Humanized. Actually it started as a copy of that project just to see what I can do myself with Python. Later on Enso became opensource and I stopped my work on this. Enso clearly provided a more professional implementation. However I stop using it all together for one reason or other.

Recently I needed some way of extended Outlook. Macros didn't work due to company regulations and I didn't want to write plugins for it. I checked where the Enso was. As far as I see community edition is not actively developed anymore. So I dediced to give it another go for my utility. 

This project will be updated if I decide to use it regularly. In such case I will add more documentation. Till than, if you need, just drop me a line.

Ah, and it will get a better name as well, hopefully.
